* All WaveRom section is aligned by 1024bytes. So the deep of this device is 1Kpts :D

* TODO:Pesudo Noise Generator Support

* All Analog parts is easy to buy, and very cheap.

* Require Bioplar 5V supply, The maximum output of this Generator is 3.3Vp-p.

* The original idea of this toy is related to http://www.myplace.nu/avr/minidds, but now his website is down QAQ
